Hi, and welcome to our website!
This is a safe place for all to come after a long day or if you're feeling stressed. 
We have ways to relieve stress, some coping mechanisms, relaxing videos and sounds, yoga and a few phone numbers incase you need to reach out to someone.
We know that school, work and life in general can be stressful and you can start to become very upset or distressed. There is no way to guarantee that you won't feel that way, but we have come up with some great solutions that we think will definitely help.

### Some things you can do to help relieve stress

- **Exercise** (Physical activity boosts your mood by helping bump up the production of your brains feel-good neurotransmitters, which are called endorphins.)

- **Play Some Music** (Listening to music is a calm, relaxing way to improve your mood. Research shows that listening to music helps with not only your mood but but it can also reduce anxiety, blood pressure and pain as well as improving your sleep and memory quality.)

- **Write It Down** ( Writing your feelings down can help you to feel better. It's good to let your feeling out and to prioritise your concerns and fears.)

- **Gum/ Lollypops** (Sucking on a lollypop helps decrease your stress levels, lower your heart rate and blood sugar. Chewing gum has also been found to reduce stress levels and your heart rate whilst also boosting your mood. Swinburne University also ran tests and found that chewing gum while working increases your awareness and overall performance.)

- **Hanging Out with Friends** (This one doesn't have any facts or statistics behind it but it's always a good idea to hang out with friends. It can improve your mood and happiness, distract you from your worries and put a smile on your face. So why not, go out with your friends, have some fun and have a laugh?)
