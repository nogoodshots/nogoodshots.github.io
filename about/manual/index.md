### Hosting
[GitHub Pages website](https://pages.github.com) is the best place to start when understanding hwo to host a Markdown website.

#### Links
I have found if I want to break my content into pages the easiest way is to create a folder containing my content in a file called ```index.md```. To link to it I then use:
```
[Link Text](folder name)
```

#### Testing locally

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
