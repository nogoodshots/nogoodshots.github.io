## About this website
This site is twofold. Firstly an experiment in the tech required to maintain and host a personal blog or website. Secondly I am growing increasingly uneasy with the established social networking tools and want to try and escape them.

As you can see I do not have much flair or experience when it comes to creating webpages. Hopefully some basic ability is a side-effect of this as well.

### Tech
This website/blog is written in Markdown a quick templating language. It is hosted on [GitHub](https://pages.github.com)
